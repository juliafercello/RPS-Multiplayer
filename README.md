# RPS-Multiplayer
Rock. Paper. Scissors.

# Project Overview
This is a traditional take on the classic rock, paper, scissors game.  As users enter the game, they are made player 1, player 2 or a spectator.  Once each player has made their choice, a modal opens showing the winner.  Closing the modal starts a new round. The game keeps track of the wins and losses per player.  All users are able to use the chat feature. 

The project utilizes firebase, session storage, jquery, bootstrap and javascript.

The game can be played here: <a href="https://juliafercello.github.io/RPS-Multiplayer/">https://juliafercello.github.io/RPS-Multiplayer/</a>

# Future Enhancements
* Make the code dry
* Notify spectators when a player spot opens up and let them switch their role
* Implement firebase users and authentication to enable multiple games going at the same time
